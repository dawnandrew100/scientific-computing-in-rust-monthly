## Crate of the month: EGObox
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/egobox) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/egobox/latest) ~ [source](https://github.com/relf/egobox)

EGObox is a Rust toolbox for **e**fficient **g**lobal **o**ptimisation. It can be used either as a
set of Rust crates, or as a Python library. We recommend starting by reading their [paper in the
Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04737).
