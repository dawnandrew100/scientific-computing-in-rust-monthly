# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #10

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME
<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).

## New releases
<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->

### [approx-derive 0.2.6](https://crates.io/crates/approx-derive)
Derive macros for the popular [approx](https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/) crate.

### [approxim 0.6.6](https://crates.io/crates/approxim)
Fork of the [approx](https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/) crate which includes many PRs and
extended functionality (such as derive macros, support for optionals, etc.)
The original crate has not been updated since ~3 years.

### [indexing_fmt 0.1.1](https://crates.io/crates/indexing_fmt)
A helper crate for formatting superscripts and subscripts.
Especially helpful when formatting variable names automatically.

### [ndelement 0.3.0](https://crates.io/crates/ndelement)
A new version of the finite element definition library ndelement has been released. This new version
adds implementations of Piola transforms to map element values to physical cells, and DOF
transformations as described in [this 2022 paper by Scroggs et al](https://doi.org/10.1145/3524456).

### [Quant-Iron 1.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/quant-iron)
A high-performance, hardware-accelerated modular quantum computing simulator library with a focus on physical applications.
`Quant-Iron` provides tools to represent quantum states, apply standard and customised quantum gates, perform measurements in multiple bases, build quantum circuits, 
implement quantum algorithms and represent and evolve quantum many-body systems using Ising models, Heisenberg models, and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and time evolution.

## Events
<!--
This section can be used to advertise events. Items should be sorted in date order, with
sooner events first, and should use the format:

### [<event name>, <day-day month year>, <location or "held virutally">, <date>](<website URL>)
<brief description of event>
-->

### [Scientific Computing in Rust 2025, recordings of talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrueqeouhcZNRW7H26DfscFjGSf0Pzd8c)
It's just over a month since this year's Scientific Computing in Rust virtual workshop took place.
Recordings of all the talks from the workshop are available on the [Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust),
or you can find links to all the recordings at https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025/timetable

## Publications
<!--
This section can be used to publicise papers, articles and blog posts published about scientific computing in Rust.
Items should be sorted in the alphabetical order of the surname of the first listed author.
Papers posted should use the following format:

### [<authors>, <title>, <journal> <volume>](<DOI>)
<brief description of paper>

Other publications should use the following format:

### [<author>, <title>](<link>)
<brief description>
-->

### [Jonas Pleyer, Christian Fleck, "cellular_raza: Cellular Agent-based Modeling from a Clean Slate", Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](10.21105/joss.07723)

cellular_raza is a cellular agent-based modeling framework which allows researchers to
construct models from a clean slate. In contrast to other agent-based modeling toolkits,
cellular_raza was designed to be free of assumptions about the underlying cellular repre-
sentation. This enables researchers to build up complex models while retaining full control
over every parameter introduced. It comes with predefined building blocks for agents and their
physical domain to quickly construct new simulations bottom-up. Furthermore, cellular_raza
can be used with the pyo3 and maturin packages and thus act as a numerical backend to a
Python package.

## Jobs
<!--
This section can be used to advertise jobs that may be of interest. Items should be sorted in the
order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<job title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of job, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Studentships
<!--
This section can be used to advertise studentships (eg PhDs, Master's programmes) that may be of interest.
Items should be sorted in the order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of studentship, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Help wanted
<!--
If you're looking for people to help develop or maintain a project, you can add it here. Items here
should be sorted in alphabetical order by project name and use the format:

### [<library name>](<link to source code repository>)
<brief description of the library and what kind of help you're interested in>
-->

### Scientific Computing in Rust newsletter editors
We're looking for and additional 1-2 people to become editors of this newsletter. Being an editor
of the newsletter means taking charge of putting together an issue of the newsletter every few months,
by encouraging and reviewing items added by the community. If you're interested in becoming one
of the editors, please email Matthew Scroggs at [rust@mscroggs.co.uk](mailto:rust@mscroggs.co.uk).
If you have any queries or questions, you can email or message Matthew on the [Rust-SciComp Zulip chat](https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/register/).

## Miscellaneous
<!--
Any items that do not fit into any other section can be added here.
