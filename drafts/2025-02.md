# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #6

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

It's a very exciting issue, as we announcing the date for the 2025 Scientific Computing in Rust Workshop:
4-6 July. You can find more details below or at [scientificcomputing.rs/2025](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025).

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items

## Crate of the month: serde
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/serde) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/serde/) ~ [source](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)

Serde is a crate for **ser**ialising and **de**serialsing data, and can be used to convert data to/from
various formats including JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, and Rust's own object notation [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron).
While not directly a scientific computing crate, it is very useful in scientific applications
for reading/writing parameters and results from/to file.

## New releases

### [globalsearch v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/globalsearch)
globalsearch is a global optimisation library that includes an implmentation of the OQNLP (OptQuest/NLP) algorithm from
["Scatter Search and Local NLP Solvers: A Multistart Framework for Global Optimization" by Ugray et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1060.0175).
It combines scatter search metaheuristics with local minimization for global optimization of nonlinear problems.


## Events

### [Scientific Computing in Rust 2025, 4-6 June 2025, held virtually](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025)
The 2025 edition of the Scientific Computing in Rust virtual workshop will take place on 4-6
June 2025. Sessions will run between 13:00 and 17:00 BST each day.
[Registration](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025/register) free, and the workshop will take
place virtually so there is no need to book travel or accommodation.

The workshop will feature a mixture of 30 minute talks by invited speakers, 10 minute talks by
workshop attendees, and interactive discussion/tutorial sessions.
If you would like to propose a 10 minute talk or an interactive tutorial, you can do so via the
forms on [talk proposal page](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025/submit-talk). The deadline
for submissions is Friday 2 May.

More information about the workshop can be found at
[scientificcomputing.rs/2025](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025).
