## Help wanted

###[InstrumentRs](https://github.com/trappitsch/instrumentRs) 

InstrumentRs is a library in early-stage development that provides a framework for communicating with scientific instruments and equipment. The main goal is to provide a simple framework with good templates to rapidly develop new drivers to control instruments with Rust. Many design and direction questions are open, e.g.:

- Should we provide synchronous or asynchronous drivers? 
- Could we provide both? 
- Should instrument control, e.g., for individual channels of a device, be shareable between threads/tasks?
- How can we make the library such that `std` is optional and drivers would work as well on embedded devices? 

If you are interested in driving scientific equipment with Rust, please check out the repository, join existing [discussions](https://github.com/trappitsch/instrumentRs/discussions), and/or open new ones to discuss ideas! Any help, ideas, questions are welcome and help!

###[multicalc](https://github.com/kmolan/multicalc-rust) 

The main goal for multicalc is to provide high accuracy solutions for single and multi-variable calculus. We're looking for contributors who enjoy doing math, and love writing rust. The github repository has an extensive README and a comprehensive suite of tests.

If you are interested in helping, please check out the repository, join discussions, and/or open new ones to discuss ideas! Any ideas or questions are welcome!

### Scientific Computing in Rust newsletter editors
We're looking for and additional 1-2 people to become editors of this newsletter. Being an editor
of the newsletter means taking charge of putting together an issue of the newsletter every few months,
by encouraging and reviewing items added by the community. If you're interested in becoming one
of the editors, please email Matthew Scroggs at [rust@mscroggs.co.uk](mailto:rust@mscroggs.co.uk).
If you have any queries or questions, you can email or message Matthew on the [Rust-SciComp Zulip chat](https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/register/).
