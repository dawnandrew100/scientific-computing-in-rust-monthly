# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #7

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).

## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME
<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).

## New releases
<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->

### [eVaiutilities v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/eVaiutilities)
eVaiutilities is a library of data management utilities for eVai developed by
Gaurav Sablok, Małgorzata Marcinkowska-Swojak, Sylwia Nawrocka, Paweł Wojciechowski, Luiza Handschuh
(Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences).
Human genomics has always been an intriguing and gleaming topic of interest. Many efforts have been
laid for understanding and identifying variants. Apart from the open source genomics efforts, proprietary
efforts have been developed for the identification and annotation of the variants. The identified variants
have been classified and linked to the several levels of the disease ontology and the metabolism levels. One
such effort is the [eVai](https://www.engenome.com/product/), which is a high throughput variant annotator, and
provides the hierarchical classification of the genomic variants. However, the limitation of the eVai output
files is the information spanning across the multiple files and the missing of the genome information and
sub-sequence analysis on the annotated variants. eVaiutilities allows, you to use the output from the eVai
and performs genome scale analysis of the eVai annotated variants. It allows you to search across populations,
variants and spanning information across multiple samples. It is encoded in RUST and provides scalability.

## Jobs
<!--
This section can be used to advertise jobs that may be of interest. Items should be sorted in the
order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [PhD positions, Postdoc positions, Software developers, and Fellowship-funded research stays, Aachen (Germany)](https://www.dwi.rwth-aachen.de/en/job-offer/computer-simulations-and-theory-various-topics)

There is a [new research group](https://www.dwi.rwth-aachen.de/en/working-group/rg-wittkowski) at the DWI - Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials in Aachen and the Department of Physics at RWTH Aachen University (Germany). Its current research projects are
- Sound-propelled microrobots
- Ultrasound-controlled 3D-bioprinting
- Computational fluid dynamics simulations
- Acoustofluidics
- Microfluidics
- Light-propelled microparticles
- Intelligent matter and artificial neural networks

There will be opportunities for
- PhD positions
- Postdoc positions
- Fellowship-funded research stays
- Scientists and software developers

The group is mainly looking for researchers who are talented and experienced in 
- Computer simulations
- Programming
- Software development

In recent years, the group has used Rust extensively to create new high-performance simulation software (see for example [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbUmxxdz_Cc) at the last SciComp Rust workshop).

If you are interested in one of these research projects and would like to work in this group, please have a look at the group's [webpage](https://www.dwi.rwth-aachen.de/en/working-group/rg-wittkowski) and follow the instructions mentioned there for applying for writing a thesis in the group or for applying for a position in the group.

## Studentships
<!--
This section can be used to advertise studentships (eg PhDs, Master's programmes) that may be of interest.
Items should be sorted in the order in which they are added and should use the format:
