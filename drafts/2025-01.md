## Crate of the month: paradis
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/paradis) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/paradis/latest/paradis/) ~ [source](https://github.com/Andlon/paradis)

Paradis is a crate that offers tools for implementing parallelisation at various levels
of abstraction. If you've not seen this crate before, we recommend starting by reading
[Andreas Longva's blog post about Paradis](https://andreaslongva.com/blog/enter-paradis/).

## New releases

### [fact.rs 0.2.0](https://crates.io/crates/factrs)
fact.rs (pronounced factors) is a nonlinear least-squares optimization library for robot sensor fusion, abstracted over factor graphs. This new release features new benchmarks, examples for custom residual and variable implementations, and the `fac!` macro for compile-time checked factor creation.

### [faer 0.21](https://crates.io/crates/faer)
faer is a Rust crate that implements low level linear algebra routines and a high level
wrapper for ease of use, in pure Rust. The aim is to provide a fully featured library for
linear algebra with focus on portability, correctness, and performance.

The latest version of faer has a simplified API and improved usability.

### [ploc 0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ploc)
This is the first release of ploc, a library for efficient Point LOCation queries.

Given a planar subdivision (i.e. a mesh) and some query points, the point location problem consists in figuring out which polygons/elements contain the query points.
This is useful in a few areas of scientific computing like interpolation of fields defined piecewise on a mesh (typically in FEM).

Ploc currently implements the trapezoidal map data structure, and is strongly influenced by matplotlib's C++ implementation.
It differentiates itself by being able to handle arbitrary planar subdivisions instead of only triangulations, and by leveraging parallelism with rayon to accelerate the queries.
