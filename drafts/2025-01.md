# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #5

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME
<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).

## New releases
<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->


### [fact.rs 0.2.0](https://crates.io/crates/factrs)
fact.rs (pronounced factors) is a nonlinear least-squares optimization library for robot sensor fusion, abstracted over factor graphs. This new release features new benchmarks, examples for custom residual and variable implementations, and the `fac!` macro for compile-time checked factor creation.

### [ploc 0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ploc)

This is the first release of ploc, a library for efficient Point LOCation queries.

Given a planar subdivision (i.e. a mesh) and some query points, the point location problem consists in figuring out which polygons/elements contain the query points.
This is useful in a few areas of scientific computing like interpolation of fields defined piecewise on a mesh (typically in FEM).

Ploc currently implements the trapezoidal map data structure, and is strongly influenced by matplotlib's C++ implementation.
It differentiates itself by being able to handle arbitrary planar subdivisions instead of only triangulations, and by leveraging parallelism with rayon to accelerate the queries.


## Events
<!--
This section can be used to advertise events. Items should be sorted in date order, with
sooner events first, and should use the format:

### [<event name>, <location or "held virutally">, <date>](<website URL>)
<brief description of event>
-->

## Publications
<!--
This section can be used to publicise papers, articles and blog posts published about scientific computing in Rust.
Items should be sorted in the alphabetical order of the surname of the first listed author.
Papers posted should use the following format:

### [<authors>, <title>, <journal> <volume>](<DOI>)
<brief description of paper>

Other publications should use the following format:

### [<author>, <title>](<link>)
<brief description>
-->

## Jobs
<!--
This section can be used to advertise jobs that may be of interest. Items should be sorted in the
order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<job title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of job, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Studentships
<!--
This section can be used to advertise studentships (eg PhDs, Master's programmes) that may be of interest.
Items should be sorted in the order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of studentship, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Help wanted
<!--
If you're looking for people to help develop or maintain a project, you can add it here. Items here
should be sorted in alphabetical order by project name and use the format:

### [<library name>](<link to source code repository>)
<brief description of the library and what kind of help you're interested in>
-->

## Miscellaneous
<!--
Any items that do not fit into any other section can be added here.
