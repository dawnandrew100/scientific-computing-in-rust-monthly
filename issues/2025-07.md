# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #10

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

It's been a busy month since the last newsletter, with this year's annual Scientific Computing in
Rust workshop taking place in July - if you missed it, you can find recordings of all the talks
on the [Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust).

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).
We're looking for volunteers to become editors of this newsletter: if you're interested, you can
find more information in the "Help wanted" section below.

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: cargo-upgrades
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-upgrades) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cargo-upgrades/2.2.2/cargo_upgrades/) ~ [source](https://gitlab.com/kornelski/cargo-upgrades)

This month's crate of the month isn't explicitly a scientific computing tool, but it's still
really useful. cargo-upgrades is a cargo extension that can be used to check if your crate's
dependencies are up to date with the most recent stable releases. We recommend getting your
CI to run this to give you a nudge when one of your dependencies has a new release you can
update to.

## New releases

### [approx-derive 0.2.6](https://crates.io/crates/approx-derive)
Derive macros for the popular [approx](https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/) crate.

### [approxim 0.6.6](https://crates.io/crates/approxim)
Fork of the [approx](https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/) crate which includes many PRs and
extended functionality (such as derive macros, support for optionals, etc.)
The original crate has not been updated since ~3 years.

### [indexing_fmt 0.1.1](https://crates.io/crates/indexing_fmt)
A helper crate for formatting superscripts and subscripts.
Especially helpful when formatting variable names automatically.

### [ndelement 0.3.0](https://crates.io/crates/ndelement)
A new version of the finite element definition library ndelement has been released. This new version
adds implementations of Piola transforms to map element values to physical cells, and DOF
transformations as described in [this 2022 paper by Scroggs et al](https://doi.org/10.1145/3524456).

### [Quant-Iron 1.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/quant-iron)
A high-performance, hardware-accelerated modular quantum computing simulator library with a focus on physical applications.
`Quant-Iron` provides tools to represent quantum states, apply standard and customised quantum gates, perform measurements in multiple bases, build quantum circuits, 
implement quantum algorithms and represent and evolve quantum many-body systems using Ising models, Heisenberg models, and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and time evolution.

### [repgenerate v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/repgenerate)
repgenerate is a Rust library that can generate illumina sequencing reports for any Illumina genetics
sequencing platform.

### [sequenceprofiler v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/sequenceprofiler)
seqeuenceprofiler is a Rust library for genetics sequencing.

## Events

### [Scientific Computing in Rust 2025, recordings of talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrueqeouhcZNRW7H26DfscFjGSf0Pzd8c)
It's just over a month since this year's Scientific Computing in Rust virtual workshop took place.
Recordings of all the talks from the workshop are available on the [Scientific Computing in Rust YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ScientificComputinginRust),
or you can find links to all the recordings at [scientificcomputing.rs/2025/timetable](https://scientificcomputing.rs/2025/timetable)

## Publications

### [Jonas Pleyer, Christian Fleck, "cellular_raza: Cellular Agent-based Modeling from a Clean Slate", Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](10.21105/joss.07723)

cellular_raza is a cellular agent-based modeling framework which allows researchers to
construct models from a clean slate. In contrast to other agent-based modeling toolkits,
cellular_raza was designed to be free of assumptions about the underlying cellular repre-
sentation. This enables researchers to build up complex models while retaining full control
over every parameter introduced. It comes with predefined building blocks for agents and their
physical domain to quickly construct new simulations bottom-up. Furthermore, cellular_raza
can be used with the pyo3 and maturin packages and thus act as a numerical backend to a
Python package.

## Help wanted

### Scientific Computing in Rust newsletter editors
We're looking for an additional 1-2 people to become editors of this newsletter. Being an editor
of the newsletter means taking charge of putting together an issue of the newsletter every few months,
by encouraging and reviewing items added by the community. If you're interested in becoming one
of the editors, please email Matthew Scroggs at [rust@mscroggs.co.uk](mailto:rust@mscroggs.co.uk).
If you have any queries or questions, you can email or message Matthew on the [Rust-SciComp Zulip chat](https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/register/).
